MLX Stable Diffusion WebUI
====================================
This is a straightforward web interface for the Apple MLX Stable Diffusion example.

It is a modified version of mlx-examples/stable-diffusion by Apple. The original code can be found at https://github.com/ml-explore/mlx-examples/tree/main/stable_diffusion

The project is purely for educational purposes and is not intended for any serious use.

Depending on the availability of free time and the level of interest, there may be further development and refinement of these ideas.

What's New
=============

ðŸ‘‰ Streamlit WebUI

ðŸ‘‰ All models from Hugging Face can be used

ðŸ‘‰ All SD 1.5 Models that can be converted to diffuser models are supported

    When you select a non-diffuser model from the list, the model will be converted to a diffuser model and saved in the `diffuser_models` folder. 
 
    The next time you run the code, the converted model will be used.

    Please note that the conversion process may take a while.

ðŸ‘‰ Implementation of Image to Image Generation

ðŸ‘‰ I2I UI Cleaned Up

ðŸ‘‰ Normalized I2I Base Image Strength Control

ðŸ‘‰ Seed Control

ðŸ‘‰ Half Precision Support

Installation
=============

To run this example, you need to install Streamlit. 

    pip install streamlit   

Alternatively, you can install it using:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

The first time you run the code with a new checkpoint, it will download it from Hugging Face, so it may take a while. Downloded checkpoints are cached, so the next time you run the code it will be faster.

How to Add Models from Hugging Face
===================================

To add a new model, you need to add a new entry to the _AVAILABLE_MODELS list in `stable_diffusion_models.py`. For example, to add the `Lykon/absolute-reality-1.81` model, you would add the following entry:

    _AVAILABLE_MODELS = [
        "stabilityai/stable-diffusion-2-1-base",
        "Lykon/dreamshaper-8",
        "Lykon/absolute-reality-1.81", # <--- Add this line
    ]

Added models will be available in the dropdown menu in the web interface automatically. XL models are not supported. 


How to Add Local Models
===================================

Just symlink your Automatic1111 Stable Diffusion models folder to the `models` folder. 

    ln -s /path/to/your/automatic1111/stable_diffusion/models_folder ./models

    ex) ln -s ~/stable-diffusion-webui/models/Stable-diffusion ./models

Note that all SDXL models are excluded based on their file names and not checked for compatibility.

You original unconverted models will remain intact. Converted models will be saved in the `diffuser_models` folder.

How to Run
=============
To run the example, simply type in terminal:

    streamlit run ./MLX-Stable-Diffusion-WebUI/main.py
